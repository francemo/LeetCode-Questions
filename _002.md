# Add Two Numbers

## Description:

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example:
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Solution:

The algorithm to solve the problem is easy: we scan through list `l1` and `l2`, compute the sum of two numbers in the corresponding position of `l1` and `l2`. If the sum is bigger than 9, we have to carry over. One thing to notice is that if we reach the end of `l1` and `l2` and there is a carry-over, we need to append a new ListNode to the end of the output list.

When I looked at this problem at the second time, my improvement is in how to treat the carry. We just need one variable to contain the sum. If the sum is bigger than 9, then the quotient is the carry and the remainder is current digit. Besides, we just need one loop, instead of three loops.

```
public class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode out = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode output = out;
        int carry = 0;
        
        while(l1!=null || l2!=null){
            carry /= 10;
            
            if(l1 != null){
                carry += l1.val;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            if(l2 != null){
                carry += l2.val;
                 l2 = l2.next;
            }
            
            output.next = new ListNode(carry>=10 ? carry-10 : carry);
            output = output.next;

        }
       
        if(carry >= 10){
            output.next = new ListNode(1);          
        }
        return out.next;
    }
    
}
```
