# Path in matrix

Please write a function to decide if there exists a path in a given matrix containing all characters of a given string. A path can begin from any position in the matrix. Every step can move one grid along any one of four directions: left, right, up, down. A path is only able to pass one position once. For example, a 3*4 matrix `[a,b,c,e,s,f,c,s,a,d,e,e]` contains a path representing the string `bcced`, but doesn't contain paths representing `abcb`, since `b` in the same position can not be included twice.


### Solution:

The question can be solved by backtracking. 

Two things for myself to remember are:

1. Altough 2D matrix is more clear to visualize the problem, we don't have to transfer 1D array to 2D array. Just use the 2D indicies (i, j) and use a simple equation to convert (i, j) to the index in 1D array, which saves space and seems cleaner.

2. The logic is: if any subpath in one of four directions coming after current position exist, we say a path exist.


```
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasPath(char[] matrix, int rows, int cols, char[] str)
    {
        if(matrix.length == 0 || str.length == 0) return false;
        boolean[] flag = new boolean[matrix.length];
        Arrays.fill(flag, true);

        for(int i=0; i<matrix.length; i++){            
            if(matrix[i] == str[0]){
                if(helper(str, matrix, flag, 0, i/cols, i%cols, rows, cols))
                    return true;
            } 
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    public boolean helper(char[] str, char[] m, boolean[] flag, int k, int i, int j, int rows, int cols){
        if(k == str.length) return true;
        int index = i * cols + j;
        if(i < 0 || i == rows || j < 0 || j== cols || !flag[index] || m[index] != str[k]) return false;
        flag[index] = false;
        if(helper(str, m, flag, k+1, i-1, j, rows, cols) ||
           helper(str, m, flag, k+1, i, j+1, rows, cols) ||
           helper(str, m, flag, k+1, i+1, j, rows, cols) ||
           helper(str, m, flag, k+1, i, j-1, rows, cols))
            return true;
        flag[index] = true;
        return false;
    }

}
```
