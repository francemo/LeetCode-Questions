# Find the minimum value in a rotated sorted array

Rotated array is a sorted array but with the first several numbers being moved to the end. For a given rotated non-decreasing array, output the minimal value in this rotated array.

### Example: 

```
Array [3,4,5,1,2] is a rotated array of [1,2,3,4,5], the minimum is 1.

```

### Note:
All number in the given array is bigger than 0. If the array is empty, return 0.


### Solution:

Binary search can be used here to locate the minimum. If the array is rotated, then there exist a minimum with an index between `l` and `r`. So we use binary search to narrow the range until `l = r`. 

If middle value `array[mid]` is bigger than the right boundary `array[r]`, then the minimum is after `mid`, so we let `l = mid + 1`. 

If `array[mid]` is smaller than the right boundary, then the minimum is before `mid`, so we let `r = mid`. The reason we don't let `r = mid -1` is to avoid losing track of the smaller part, i.e. the part moved from the beginning of the original sorted array.

Otherwise, if `array[mid] == array[r]`, the relation of `mid` and minimum is not clear and binary search is not applicable. We just decrease `l` to check the next value.


```
public class Solution {
    public int minNumberInRotateArray(int [] array) {
        int n = array.length;
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if(n == 1) return array[0];
        if(array[0] < array[n-1])
            return array[0];
        int l = 0, r = n-1, mid = 0;
        while(l <= r){
            mid = (l+r)/2;
            if(array[mid] > array[r]) l = mid + 1;
            else if(array[mid] < array[r]) r = mid;
            else l++;
        }
        return array[mid];
    }
}

```
