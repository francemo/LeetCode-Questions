# Get k-th node of a binary search tree

Given a binary search tree, please find the k-th least node. For example in (5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8), the third least node is the node with value 3.



### Solution:

I considered the problem as counting the numbers of nodes in subtrees from left most to right most. In fact, it is the in-order traversal problem! In the end those two ways have the exact same codes.

```
public class Solution {
    int index = 0;
    TreeNode KthNode(TreeNode pRoot, int k)
    {
        if(pRoot == null) return null;
        TreeNode p = KthNode(pRoot.left, k);
        if(p != null) return p;
        index++;
        if(index == k) return pRoot;
        p = KthNode(pRoot.right, k);
        return p;
    }

}
```
