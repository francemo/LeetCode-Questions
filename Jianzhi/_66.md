# Range of robot's motion

For a m*n matrix, a robot starts from (0,0) and moves one grid toward left or right or up or down every time, but it can't go to grids whose sum of digits of row and column indices is bigger than k. For example, when k = 18, the robot can go to grid (35, 37) since 3 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 18. But it can't go to (35, 38) because 3 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 19. Please find out the number of grids the robot can go to.

### Solution:

This can be solved by recursion/backtracking/dynamic programming. I am not sure how to name it, but the idea is we compute number of achievable grids from (0, 0) recursively. Since the robot move in four directions, the number of achievable grids from any point (i, j) equals to the sum of number of achievable grids from (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j) and (i, j-1) plus 1. We use a `flag` matrix to label the grid already been counted to avoid repetition.


```
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Solution {
    public int movingCount(int threshold, int rows, int cols)
    {
        boolean[][] flag = new boolean[rows][cols];
        for(int i=0; i<rows; i++)
            Arrays.fill(flag[i], true);
        return helper(flag, rows, cols, threshold, 0, 0);
    }
    
    public int helper(boolean[][] flag, int rows, int cols, int t, int i, int j){
        if(i < 0 || i == rows || j < 0 || j == cols || 
           digitSum(i)+digitSum(j) > t || !flag[i][j]) return 0;
        flag[i][j] = false;
        return 1 + helper(flag, rows, cols, t, i-1, j) +
               helper(flag, rows, cols, t, i, j+1) +
               helper(flag, rows, cols, t, i+1, j) +
               helper(flag, rows, cols, t, i, j-1);
    }
    
    public int digitSum(int m){
        int sum = 0;
        while(m > 0){
            sum += m%10;
            m /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
