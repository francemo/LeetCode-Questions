# Has subtree

Given two binary trees A and B, decide if B is a subtree of A. We assume empty tree is not a subtree of any tree.

### Solution:

My instinct is to first find the root value of B in tree A, then compare that subtree with B. But it's not clear about how to find all the eligible subroots. One way is to scan all the nodes of tree A and store the nodes with the same value with root of tree B. For every subtree rooted in every stored node, we compare it with tree B. If all the stored subtrees are different from B, then we return false, otherwise we return true. But this will take lots of space.

Another way is to do it recursively, since most of tree problems involve recursion. Fist we check if the current subtree with `root` equals to tree B, if it is we return true, if it's not, we continue to check the left subtree with root `root.left` and the right subtree with root `root.right`. Meanwhile, we need a separate function to compare two trees, which also proceeds recursively.

After all, the pattern `process the tree with current root, then process the left tree and the right tree` is very useful for tree problems.

Codes are shown as following.

```
/**
public class TreeNode {
    int val = 0;
    TreeNode left = null;
    TreeNode right = null;

    public TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;

    }

}
*/

public class Solution {
    public boolean HasSubtree(TreeNode root1,TreeNode root2) {
        if(root1 == null || root2 == null) return false;
        if(isEqual(root1, root2)){
            return true;
        }else{
            if(root1.left != null && HasSubtree(root1.left, root2))
                return true;
            if(root1.right != null && HasSubtree(root1.right, root2)){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;       
    }
    
    boolean isEqual(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2){
        if(root1 == null || root1.val != root2.val) return false;
        if(root2.left != null && !isEqual(root1.left, root2.left)){
            return false;
        }
        if(root2.right != null && !isEqual(root1.right, root2.right)){
           return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
