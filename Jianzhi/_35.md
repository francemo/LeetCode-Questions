# Count inverse ordered pairs

For any two numbers in the array, if the formar number is bigger than the latter one, these two numbers form an inverse ordered pair. For a given array, count the number of inverse ordered pairs `P` and return the result of `P` mod 1000000007.

### Note:

Assume all the numbers in the array are distinct. 

Data range:

50% input has size <= 10^4,
75% input has size <= 10^5,
100% input has size <= 2*10^5.

### Example:

Input: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0
Output: 7


### Solution:

The number of reverse ordered pairs is closely related to sorting. 

I was only able to figure out the basic algorithm, which compares each number with all other numbers after it. Its time complexity is O(N^2). 

A better solution with O(NlogN) comlexity uses merge sort. If the first half and the second half of the array are in order, we can decide the number of reverse ordered pairs by scanning the whole array one time in the manner of merge sort. If a number `arr[j]` in the second half is smaller than a number `arr[i]` in the first half, then all the numbers after `arr[i]` in the first half are bigger than `arr[j]`. Thus we have `mid-i+1` reverse ordered pairs. To make sure each half is in order, we need to first divide each half into two parts, sort them and count reverse ordered pairs. So it proceeds recursively.

```

public class Solution {
    int c = 0;
    public int InversePairs(int [] array) {
        int size = array.length;
        if(size == 0) return 0;
        int[] tmp = new int[size];
        mergeSort(array, tmp, 0, size-1);
        return c;
    }
    
    public void mergeSort(int[] array, int[] tmp, int start, int end){
        if(start >= end) return;
        int mid = (start + end)/2;
        mergeSort(array, tmp, start, mid);
        mergeSort(array, tmp, mid+1, end);
        merge(array, tmp, start, mid, end);
    }
    
    public void merge(int[] array, int[] tmp, int start, int mid, int end){
        int i = start, j = mid+1, k = start;;
        while(i <= mid && j<=end){
            if(array[i] < array[j])
                tmp[k++] = array[i++];
            else{
                tmp[k++] = array[j++];
                c = (c + mid - i + 1)%1000000007;
            }
        }
        while(i <= mid)  tmp[k++] = array[i++];
        while(j <= end) tmp[k++] = array[j++];
        for(k=start; k<=end; k++){
            array[k] = tmp[k];
        }
    }
}

```
