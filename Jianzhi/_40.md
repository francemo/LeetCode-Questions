# Find the numbers only apear once

In an integer array, all numbers appear even times except two numbers. Please find both numbers appeared only once.


### Solution:

We know another easier variation of this problem: there is only one number appearing once in this array, and all the other numbers appear even times. Its solution is to compute the xor of all numbers in the array. Xor of those numbers appearing even times are 0, then we will have the number appeared only once as the result.

But in this question, if we get the xor of all numbers, it's the xor of two numbers appearing once. To separate both numbers, here comes the magic. Since both numbers are different, we find the first 1 in the xor and record its index in the variable `index`. Based on `index`-th digit in binary representation being 0 or 1, we can divide all numbers into two groups. Then within each group, the problem regress to the easier one.


```
//num1 and num2 are two arraies with length 1
//return results as num1[0] and num2[0]
public class Solution {
    public void FindNumsAppearOnce(int [] array, int num1[], int num2[]) {
        int size = array.length;
        if(size == 0) return;
        int xor = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++)
            xor ^= array[i];
        int index = 0;
        while((xor & 1) == 0){
            index++;
            xor >>= 1;
        }
        int temp = 1 << index;
        num1[0] = 0; num2[0] = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
            if((array[i] & temp) == temp)
                num1[0] ^= array[i];
            else
                num2[0] ^= array[i];
        }
    }
}
```
