# Count the number of 1s in a binary number

Given an integer, output the number of 1s in its binary representation. Note negative numers are represented in its two's compliment.

### Solution:

Using bit manipulation, we can solve it without division. And by proper bit operations, we don't have check every bit of 32 bits.

```
    public static int NumberOf1(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int flag = 1;
        while (flag != 0) {
            if ((n & flag) != 0) {
                count++;
            }
            flag = flag << 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
```


A quick method is shown below. By `n = (n-1) & n`, we can directly check every `1` in binary sequence.

```
    public static int NumberOf1(int n) {
       
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            ++count;
            n = (n - 1) & n;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
