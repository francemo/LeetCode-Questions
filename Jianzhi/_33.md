# Ugly Number

We call the numbers only with prime factor 2, 3, 5 "Ugly Number". For example, 6, 8 are ugly numbers, but 14 is not, since it has prime factor 7. We set 1 as the first ugly number. Please find the N-th ugly number in increasing order.

### Solution:

I was thinking in the direction that for every number before n-th ugly number, we compute all its factors, if there is any prime factor other than 2, 3, 5, we continue to check next number. However the time complexity is about O(N^3), which is way too high.

So a clever way is to store previous ugly number, and grow progressively. Because every ugly number is computed from another ugly number by multipling 2, 3 or 5.


```
public class Solution {

    public int GetUglyNumber_Solution(int index) {
        if(index <= 0) return 0;
        int[] arr = new int[index];
        arr[0] =1;
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0, i = 1;
        while(i<index){
            int min = Math.min(arr[p1]*2, Math.min(arr[p2]*3, arr[p3]*5));
            if(arr[p1]*2 == min) p1++;
            if(arr[p2]*3 == min) p2++;
            if(arr[p3]*5 == min) p3++;
            arr[i++] = min;
        }
        return arr[index-1];
    }

}
```
