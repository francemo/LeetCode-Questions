# Find the first common node in two linked lists

Given two linked list, find the first common node.

### Solution:

One usual way is to count the difference of lengths of two linked list, and let pointer of the longer list goes earlier with steps of the difference. Two pointers will meet at the first common node. If the common nodes don't exist, they will read the end of lists at the same time.

There is another way with the same idea, but with a shorter code and doesn't have to count the lengths. We scan two lists together. The shorter list will reach its end first, meanwhile, the number of remaining nodes in the longer list is right equal to the difference of lengths of two lists. We reset the pointer of shorter list to the head of the longer list, and move together with the other pointer. Now two points both point to the longer list. When the latter pointer reaches the end of the longer list, the former pointer skips `difference of lengths` number of nodes in the longer list. Then we reset the latter pointer to the head of the shorter list. Now two points points to two lists, and two lists are right aligned. We continue to move both points together. They will arrive at the fist common node or null at the same time.


```
public class Solution {
    public ListNode FindFirstCommonNode(ListNode pHead1, ListNode pHead2) {
        ListNode p1 = pHead1, p2 = pHead2;
        while(p1 != p2){
            p1 = (p1 == null ? pHead2 : p1.next);
            p2 = (p2 == null ? pHead1 : p2.next);
        }
        return p1;
    }
}

```
