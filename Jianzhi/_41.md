# Compute the continuous positive integer sequence with a given sum

For a given number 'S', compute all continuous positive integer sequences with the sum equal to 'S'. For example, when 'S = 100', we have two continuous sequences: `[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]`, `[18, 19, 20, 21, 22]`. 

Please find all continuous positive integer sequences with the sum 'S'. Within each sequence, numbers should be in increasing order. For different sequences, the sequence should be in increasing order in terms of the first number.


### Solution:

Instead of looking for the start and end number and compute their sum by the equation, we can solve it by considering the length of the sequence. Let the length of a candidate sequence be `l`. Then the average of numbers in this sequence is `S/l`. If `l` is even, then `S%l*2` must be equal to `l`. If `l` is odd, then `S%l` must be 0. 

We start from the biggest length to make sure the sequences with a smaller first number to be added first.


```
import java.util.ArrayList;
public class Solution {
    public ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer> > FindContinuousSequence(int sum) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> list = new ArrayList();
        int digit = 0, n = 0;
        while((1+digit)*digit/2 < sum) digit++;
        while(digit > 1){
            if(sum%digit*2 == digit || (digit & 1) == 1 && sum%digit == 0){
                ArrayList<Integer> cur = new ArrayList();
                for(int i=sum/digit-(digit-1)/2; i<=sum/digit+digit/2; i++)
                    cur.add(i);
                list.add(cur);
            }
            digit--;
        }
        return list;
    }
}
```
