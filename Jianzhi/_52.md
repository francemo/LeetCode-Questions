# Regular expression matching

Given a string, decide if it matches a given pattern. A pattern is a string composed of characters, `.`, and `*`. `.` can represent any character. A character followed by `*` can appear any number of times, including of 0. A string is said to be matched with a pattern if all characters in the string match all the symbols in the pattern. For example, string `aaa` matches patterns `a.a` and `ab*ac*a`, but doesn't match `aa.a` and `ab*a`.


### Solution:

We want to compare letter by letter from left to right, if we reach the end of both string and pattern, we say they are matched. The key to handle symbol `*`, since the pattern `character + *` can used to compare to mutilple characters in string. This can be solve by recursion. 

We check first two symbols in pattern, if the second one is `*`, we either ignore first two symbols or continue use both symbols to compare the next character in string. In the first case, `s` matches `p` if `s[0 : ]` matches the substring `p[2 : ]`. In the second case, `s` matches `p` if `s[0] == p[0]` and the subtring `s[1 : ]` matches `p[0 : ]`. 

If there is no second symbol in `p` or the second symbol in `p` is not `*`, we return the results of `s[0] == p[0]` `&&` the result of `s[1 : ]` matches `p[1 : ]`.

We check from left to right, so we need two pointers `i` and `j` to denote the indices of the characters we are comparing. 


```
public class Solution {
    public boolean match(char[] str, char[] pattern)
    {
        return helper(str, 0, pattern, 0);
    }
    
    public boolean helper(char[] s, int i, char[] p, int j){
        if(i == s.length && j == p.length) return true;
        if(i < s.length && j == p.length) return false;
        boolean firstMatch = (i < s.length && (s[i] == p[j] || p[j] == '.'));
        
        if(j < p.length-1 && p[j+1] == '*')
            return helper(s, i, p, j+2) || (firstMatch && helper(s, i+1, p, j));
        else
            return firstMatch && helper(s, i+1, p, j+1);
    }
}
```
