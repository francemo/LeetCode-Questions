# Balanced binary tree

Given a binary tree, decide if it is a balanced binary tree. A binary tree is defined as balanced if it's an empty tree or it has balanced left and right subtrees and the heights of both subtrees have a difference no more than 1.

### Solution:

We should check if each subtree of root is balanced and compare the height of each subtree. This can be solved recursively as shown in the following.

```
public class Solution {
    public boolean IsBalanced_Solution(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return true;
        return IsBalanced_Solution(root.left) &&
               IsBalanced_Solution(root.right) &&
               Math.abs(height(root.left) - height(root.right)) <= 1;
    }
     
    public int height(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return 0;
        return Math.max(height(root.left), height(root.right))+1;
    }
}

```

However, the way we compute height of each subtree is not efficient, because we repeatedly visit the nodes. In fact, the problem can be solved while we compute the height of each subtree. We start from the left most node on the bottom level. If current subtree is balanced, we return the height of current subtree, and continue to check its parent tree. If current tree is not balanced, we return -1 and stop.

```
public class Solution {
    public boolean IsBalanced_Solution(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return true;
        return height(root) != -1;
    }
    
    public int height(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int left = height(root.left);
        if(left == -1) return -1;
        int right = height(root.right);
        if(right == -1) return -1;
        if(Math.abs(left - right) > 1) return -1;
        return Math.max(left, right)+1;
    }
}
```
