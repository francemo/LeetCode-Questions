# Do addition without "+, -, *, /"

Compute the sum of two given numbers without using "+, -, *, /".

### Solution:

By bit matipulation, each digit without carry can be computed by '^' operation. The problem is to deal with carry. By bit '&', we can get the carry of two numbers. Then we need to add both results together, which is again an addition. So we do it in a loop, and it stops when one of both numbers is 0.


```
public class Solution {
    public int Add(int num1,int num2) {
        while(num2 != 0){
            int temp = num1 ^ num2;
            num2 = (num1 & num2) << 1;
            num1 = temp;
        }
        return num1;
    }
}
```
