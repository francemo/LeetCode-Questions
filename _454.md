# 4Sum II

## Description:

Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.

### Example:
```
Input:
A = [ 1, 2]
B = [-2,-1]
C = [-1, 2]
D = [ 0, 2]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two tuples are:
1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0
```

## Solution:

At first glance, brute force with time complexity O(N^4) is needed. In fact, `4Sum II` is easier than `4Sum`. We don't need to consider the duplicate numbers, the indices of those four numbers are independent. We just record all the sum appeared in the array `A` and `B` to a hashmap with the key being the number of appearance. Then, we go through all pairs in array `C` and `D`. If the opposite number of `C[i]+D[j]` is found in the hashmap, the value of key `-C[i]-D[j]` is added to the count.


```
class Solution {
    public int fourSumCount(int[] A, int[] B, int[] C, int[] D) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm12 = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();

        for(int i=0; i<A.length; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<B.length; j++){
                hm12.put(A[i]+B[j], hm12.getOrDefault(A[i]+B[j], 0) + 1);                
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<C.length; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<D.length; j++){
                count += hm12.getOrDefault(-C[i]-D[j], 0);
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
