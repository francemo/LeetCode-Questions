# Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

The simplest way is to do a linear search for each number in `nums` to find the other number adding up to the target. This requires O(N^2) time and constant space.

```
public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] result = new int[2];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++) {
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.length;j++) {
                if(nums[i]+nums[j] == target){
                    result[0] = i;
                    result[1] = j;
                    break;
                }
                    
            }
        }
         return result;
    }
}

A better way with a complexity of O(N) is to use HashMap. We use the number as key, and its index as value. All the number we checked will be put in the hashmap such that it takes constant time to get the index of a required number. We stop the loop when the `target-number` is found in the hashmap. However the space complexity will become O(N).

```
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int[] result = new int[2];
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
            int num2find = target - nums[i];
            if(hm.get(num2find) != null){
                result[0] = hm.get(num2find);
                result[1] = i;
                break;
            }
            hm.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

```
